# Data-Science-Salary-Prediction

Salary disparity is a persistent issue across industries and geographic locations. Factors such as experience, education, job title, company size, location, and skills significantly influence an individual's earning potential. This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of estimating an individual's salary based on these and other relevant factors.

By leveraging the power of data science and machine learning, we seek to create a tool that can provide valuable insights into salary trends, identify potential biases, and assist individuals in making informed career decisions. This project will involve collecting and cleaning salary-related data, performing exploratory data analysis to understand underlying patterns, and building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict salaries accurately.

Ultimately, this project strives to contribute to a more equitable and transparent job market by shedding light on the factors that determine salary levels.
